# Installation instructions

1. Install Cozify Python libraries with pip install cozify
2. Get my scripts (SORRY! If you are reading this during Zabbix Summit, the scripts are not here YET but will be soon; our eight weeks old baby has slowed me down quite a bit)
3. Run scripts inside screen/tmux, during boot, whatever you see fit
4. Modify pretty much everything from my template to suit your own Cozify, this is just an ugly hack to do something and is very manual in its approach, as I spend like 30-60 minutes per week for my blog posts and pretty much brute force my blog entries
