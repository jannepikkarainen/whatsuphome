# What's up, home?

I monitor my home wtth Zabbix & Grafana and do some weird experiments with them. As these templates are just for fun at home and proof-of-concepts more than actual production quality, use these with care.

So far my blog series has 118 parts, out of which the first three are outright boring, and after that things got more interesting. Much more interesting, even. I have also kept multiple speeches about this project at Zabbix Summit events.
